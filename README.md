HTML5 Podcast Client

Everything is done in standard HTML, CSS & JS combo. Just clone the repo and load the index.html in any browser that supports AUDIO tag.

=========
Details of some importance: 

* The podcast picker is a simple drop-down menu which is populated statically in body of HTML page. This kinda sucks because it's not "dynamic" but remember that this app is to scratch my own itch. Fork it if you wish.

* HTML5 audio tag is responsible for the playback so browser-wise use something new, something fresh.

* As playback goes, playlist is filled with ten last episodes of a certain feed and it will autoplay one after the other. Also, if you switch to other episode or a podcast altogether while the one that you were listening to is not finished yet, player will magically know where you stopped so if you chose to continue with the previous, he will play from that moment. (This works until you close the tab and the cache is gone)

* Also, spacebar toggles PAUSE/PLAY.

Have fun!
